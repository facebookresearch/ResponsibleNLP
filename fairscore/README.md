## PANDA
Perturbation Augmentation NLP DAtaset (PANDA) consists of approximately 100K pairs of human-perturbed text snippets (source, perturbed). PANDA can be used for training a learned perturber that can rewrite text along three demographic axes (age, gender, race), in a way that preserves semantic meaning. PANDA can also be used to evaluate the demographic robustness of language models.

## NOTE
Pretrained models can be found at https://huggingface.co/facebook/FairBERTa and https://huggingface.co/facebook/perturber.
